## Introduction

My name is Rog√©rio, enrolled in mathematics at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). Currently studying and developing an API in Flask for uploading files to Obsidian, I'm looking for a job opportunity as a developer.

## Studies

In my personal studies, I am interested in backend development and AI. I have a little familiarity with relational and non-relational databases and a personal passion for hardware, using it in conjunction with AI and Deep Learning to develop biomechanical prostheses.

Personally, I believe that the habit of programming and solving equations helps me more and more and develop and organize my logical reasoning, which I think is one of the fundamental skills for a programmer.
