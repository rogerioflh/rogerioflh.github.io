## Introduction

My name is Rogério, enrolled in mathematics at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL). Currently studying and developing an API in Flask for uploading files to Obsidian, I'm looking for a job opportunity as a developer.

## Studies

In my personal studies, I am interested in backend development and AI. I have a little familiarity with relational and non-relational databases and a personal passion for hardware, using it in conjunction with AI and Deep Learning to develop biomechanical prostheses.

Personally, I believe that the habit of programming and solving equations helps me more and more and develop and organize my logical reasoning, which I think is one of the fundamental skills for a programmer.
